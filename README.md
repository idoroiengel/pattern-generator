My newest freshest Flutter project

I wanted to explore the patterns world. We're talking about design patterns that you'd see on clothes, furniture etc. Basically, I wish to take the Flutter framework to the limits, to see what can be accomplished with it.

I started with a basic checkerboard pattern, which is your regular [GridView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html) that contains rectangles in two different colors. This looks very neat, when you choose two colors that are only slightly different, it makes a cool visual effect to watch. You can also choose your classic [black & white checkerboard](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Checkerboard_pattern.svg). Do try the variants of the "some color" & white checkerboard, it's really cool!

The argyle patern is a bit more complicated, in terms of laying out the Rhombuses as you'd expect from an actual Argyle pattern. This is my next goal for this project.

The next pattern I would like to implement is using an image or an icon and repeating it over a certain background, i.e [Polka dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polka_dot). This looks pretty straight forwarf on the surface of it, but I'd like to improve this basic pattern and let the user control the size of the dots, their spacing, varying number of colors for the dots etc.
